This is a pretty printer similar to 4bsd's "vgrind" except it uses
TeX instead of troff.  It was written by Van Jacobson of Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory (van@lbl-rtsg.arpa).

To install it:

 (1) Decide where you want to put the program (I suggest /usr/local).

 (2) Edit "Makefile":
       set DESTDIR to the program destination directory.
	 (the tgrind shell script, tgrind.sh, will go here.  Also
	 the formatting program, tfontedpr, will go into the "lib"
	 subdirectory of DESTDIR, e.g., /usr/local/lib).
       set TEXINPUTS to the pathname of your TeX "\input" directory
	 (the TeX macro file "tgrindmac.tex" will get put here).
       set DEFSFILE to the pathname of your vgrind language definitions
	 file.  If you're running 4.2bsd, this is "/usr/lib/vgrindefs".
	 Both vgrind & tgrind can use the same file.  A vgrindefs file
	 that has been updated considerably since the 4.2 distribution
	 is included in this directory ("vgrindefs.src").

  (3) Edit "tgrind.sh":
       Put the pathname for tfontedpr in the "set b=" statement.
       Put the pathname for TeX in the "set tex=" statement.
       Look at the comments about output routing & do whatever you
	 think is appropriate.

  (4) Type "make install".

Good luck.  Please let me know of any problems, enhancements, suggestions, etc.
