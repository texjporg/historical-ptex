This directory contains a paper which describes design tradeoffs of
MakeIndex.  It is written in LaTeX and contains a figure in PostScript
specifed in the psfig format.  Run LaTeX on the file ind.tex to obtain
a DVI file.  All style files involved are included in this directory.
To print it, you need to have a PostScript-based printer and the
DVI-to-PostScript driver must understand the psfig format.  A
PostScipt version of this paper, ind.ps, can be printed directly to a
PostScript printer.

This paper will appear in Software: Practice and Experience, 1988.  A
more complete version is available as Computer Science Tech. Report
87/347, University of California, Berkeley, March 1987.

P.S.
For the benefit of sites which do not have a DVI driver capable of 
supporting the figure insertion, I have prepared a PostScript 
printer-ready file in ind.ps.
