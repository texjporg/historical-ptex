MakeIndex is Copyright (C) 1987, 1988 by Pehong Chen (phc@berkeley.edu)
All rights reserved.

MakeIndex is a general purpose index processor.  This release contains
this README file, a COPYING notice, a doc directory, a paper directory,
a src directory, a lib directory, and a test directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everyone should read COPYING before installing or distributing MakeIndex.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The doc directory contains

makeindex.info		an Emacs (TOPS-20 and GNU) INFO node produced
			automatically from makeindex.vms by vmshelp
			(available from Utah)

makeindex.l		a UNIX man page

makeindex.ps		PostScript translation of makeindex.l

makeindex.tex		documentation for the use under	LaTeX
			by Leslie Lamport

makeindex.vms		VAX/VMS equivalent of makeindex.l suitable
			for inclusion in a local help library

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a detailed discussion on the design of MakeIndex, please read

	Pehong Chen and Michael Harrison, ``Automating Index Preparation'',
	Tech. Report No. 87/347, Computer Science Division,
	University of California, Berkeley, March 1987.

A version of this report is included in the paper directory.  A
somewhat condensed version entitled

	``Index Preparation and Processing''

will appear in Software: Practice and Experience, 1988.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The src directory contains the C source of MakeIndex.  This current
version is known to compile and run on UNIX (cc and gcc), VAX/VMS (VMS
cc), TOPS-20 (kcc-20 and pcc-20), and IBM PC DOS (Microsoft C Version
5.0); Atari ST support is present as well, but has not been tested as
of late January 1988.

Type make to compile under UNIX.  Makefiles for the other operating
systems are included as well.  Implementations of Make for them are
available as part of the Utah DVI driver distribution (send e-mail to
beebe@science.utah.edu).

Early porting work was carried out by Charles Karney
(karney%ppc.mfenet@nmfecc.arpa) at Princeton University and David J.
Buerger (dbeurger%scu.bitnet@jade.berkeley.edu) at University of Santa
Clara.  These efforts were independent of the port to PC DOS, TOPS-20,
VAX VMS, and the draft-ANSI C environment for version 2.3 carried out
by Nelson H.F. Beebe (beebe@science.utah.edu).  That port is described
in the file src/README in the src directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The lib directory contains the file idxmac.tex, which is an excerpt of
LaTeX's macros for indexing.  This file can be included in plain TeX
documents to generate the .idx file.  Similarly, the file
idxmac-amstex.tex can be used with AmSTeX.  Some hacking may be
necessary to incorporate it with other dialects.  Some people have
complained not having the LaTeX sty file mentioned in
doc/makeindex.tex in their library, so a copy of makeidx.sty and
makeidx.doc is also included in the lib directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The test directory contains three sets of test files

book.idx		Raw index generated from ``The Technology War'',
			David Brandin and Michael Harrison,
			John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1988.

torture.idx		a host of odd raw index entries

test.tex, test.idx	a version of doc/makeindex.tex (due to Leslie Lamport)
			that incorporates index entries (prepared by Beebe).
			This can be used both to test MakeIndex, as well as to
			illustrate the production of an index for new users.
			Read src/README for more info.

All three files come with .bak files for both the processed index (the
.ind file) and the log (the .ilg file).  Comparisons can be made
against these files to make sure your version of MakeIndex works
correctly.
