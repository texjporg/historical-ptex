.I F2tpic
translates fig objects in the named
.I input_file
into TPIC macros and puts them in
.I output_file.
If a file name is presented, it is assumed to be the input file (fig 
output file). The output file
.I (output_file),

is not presented, input will be assumed to come from the stdin.
The output from f2tpic can be edited to change font sizes/types.
.LP
Fig (Facility for Interactive Generation of figures) is a screen-oriented
tool which allows the user to draw and manipulate objects interactively.
It runs under the Suntools/Sunview window environment.
Fig2tex is compatible with Fig versions 1.3 and 1.4.
.LP
TPIC is a set of specials commas which produce graphics
instructions in the DVI file produced by TeX. However, the graphics in
the resulting DVI file can only be repviewed or printed using software which
underatnds these commands.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s
Set the scale factor at which the figure is rendered to
.I mag.
The default is 80.0 ppi (point per inch).
.TP
.B \-d 
Force open spline development. Otherwise f2tpic use \\special{sp} for
open spline (by default). For closed spline or interporated spline, f2tpic
develop these curves into lines.
.SH
F2tpic is actualy independent from tpic translator and pic macros. So you
