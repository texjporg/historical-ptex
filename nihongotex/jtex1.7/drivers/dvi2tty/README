                DVI2TTY


dvi2tty is intended for previewing dvi-files on text-only
devices (terminals and lineprinters).
The program is an improved C version of the pascal program
written by Svante Lindahl (see README.ORG).
I translated it because I could not find a pascal compiler 
on our machine that could compile it.

Kanji code can be selected in Makefile.
	CFLAGS =  -O -DDEFAULT_KANJI_CODE=SJIS
JIS/SJIS/EUC are supported. This setting can be overridden using
environment variable RNKJ.
	setenv RNKJ E		for EUC
	setenv RNKJ S		for Shift JIS
	setenv RNKJ J@B		for JIS with ESC-$-@ and ESC-(-B

                DVIDIS

dvidis is a simple hack that dumps a dvi file in a more readable form.
It is not a spectacular program but use it and improve as you wish.
I'd appreciate any enhancements made, bug reports etc. mailed to me.
