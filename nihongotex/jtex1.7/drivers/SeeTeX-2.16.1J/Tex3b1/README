To make tex3b1 you need to first check the Makefile and edit it as
necessary.  Then type make.  It should all work.

If you can arrange it, link with -lmalloc.  This will require using
something like "shcc" if you also want the shared library.  I find
tex3b1 is somewhat quicker than with the "standard" version of malloc.

I've bundled up a shar archive that I hope can be easily integrated into
the current SeeTeX distrubution.  It's 2 directories, tex3b1 which contains
the tex3b1 sources, and libtex which contains Makefile.3b1 and libtex.patches.
I made the makefile in tex3b1 automatically call make in the libtex directory.
I was hoping to just override the make variables and use the existing
Makefile, but it would insist on calling imake to make a new makefile when
compiling font.c.  So I gave in and made my own.  The patches change the
#include's for 2 of the libtex source files (under the direction of
#ifdef unixpc).  Seek.c needs to include <fcntl.h> instead of <sys/fcntl.h>
and font.c needs to include <unistd.h> (in order to get the definition for
R_OK).

If this is not what you need let me know so I can fix it up.
