NAME
     pstex - convert LaTeX figures.

SYNOPSIS
     pstex [ options ] file[.tex]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_s_t_e_x is a BiBTeX-like processor for including figures  into
     LaTeX  documents.  Figures are included using the ``\psbox''
     macro; this macro  causes  LaTeX  to  make  entries  in  the
     ``.aux''  file(s)  for  the job.  _P_s_t_e_x finds these entries,
     locates the corresponding PostScript files (which should  be
     in EPSF format as appropriate for _d_v_i_p_s), and determines how
     to size the figure according to the options specified in the
     macro  in  the  LaTeX, and according to the nominal size and
     shape of the PostScript.  It creates a  ``.psz''  file  con-
     taining entries indicating the sizes which it has determined
     to be appropriate for each figure.  When LaTeX starts up  on
     subsequent  passes, this ``.psz'' file is read, and LaTeX is
     then able to leave the correct amount of space for each fig-
     ure as it encounters them in the text.

     The ``postscript'' macro file must be included in  the  list
     of  options  in the documentstyle command.  This defines the
     necessary macros.

     The    primitive    which    is    used    by    _p_s_t_e_x    is
     ``\postscriptbox{width}{height}{file}''.   This  causes  the
     postscript of file.ps to be included into  the  document  so
     that  its  bounding  box  exactly fills the width and height
     specified.  This creates a box, which is just like a charac-
     ter,  and can be placed anywhere in the document.  Typically
     it is included within a  figure  environment  and  a  center
     environment, and is associated with a caption.

     The higher  level  macro  which  is  provided  by  _p_s_t_e_x  is
     ``\psbox[options]{file}''.

     If the options string is omitted completely, the  figure  is
     included at its natural, or design size, as specified in the
     bounding box data of the PostScript.

     Combinations of four options can be specified, separated  by
     commas: _w_i_d_t_h=<_w_i_d_t_h>, _h_e_i_g_h_t=<_h_e_i_g_h_t>, _a_s_p_e_c_t=<_a_s_p_e_c_t>, and
     _s_c_a_l_e=<_s_c_a_l_e> The keyword can be abbreviated, and spaces are
     allowed.   The width and height options can be any valid TeX
     or LaTeX which expands into a dimension when placed  as  the
     argument    to    a    setlength    macro.    For   example,
     _w_i_d_t_h=\_c_o_l_u_m_n_w_i_d_t_h is a common  specification.   The  aspect
     ratio and scale parameters must be floating point constants,
     or must expand to such  at  the  time  the  macro  is  first
     invoked, for example _s_c_a_l_e=_0._7.

     If one of width or height is specified, the figure is scaled
     to  that size, keeping its natural aspect ratio, unless that
     is overridden by the aspect parameter.

     If both of width and height are  specified,  the  figure  is
     made to fit the specification exactly, if necessary changing
     its aspect ratio.  In this mode, the aspect ratio  parameter
     is ignored.

     In any mode, the  scale  parameter  multiplies  all  of  the
     dimensions.   This  is especially useful to include a figure
     at some fixed fraction of its natural size, specifying  only
     a scale factor in the options.

     Note that the dimensions can be TeX rubber dimensions so  as
     to  fit into the page layout in the best possible manner, if
     desired.

EXAMPLES
     (Note that the slash characters below represent backslashes,
     which are hard to include in troff text!)

     /_p_s_b_o_x{_f_i_l_e}
          Include file.ps at natural size.

     /_p_s_b_o_x[_s=_0._7]{_f_i_l_e}
          Include the document at natural  size  scaled  down  to
          70%.

     /_p_s_b_o_x[_w=/_c_o_l_u_m_n_w_i_d_t_h, _s_c_a_l_e=/_m_y_d_o_c_s_c_a_l_e]{_f_i_l_e}
          Stretch the figure to the  width  of  the  column,  but
          scale it down to /mydocscale (which might be defined as
          0.9 for example).

OPTIONS
     -z _p_s_d_i_r_s Specify different area for postscript files to  be
               included.    _P_s_d_i_r_s  will  be   searched  for  all
               postscript files, instead of the path specified in
               the environment variable.

ENVIRONMENT
     DVIPSPATH A  list  of  colon-separated   directories   where
               PostScript files may be found for insertion.    It
               defaults  to  ``:/usr/spar/font/ps''  which  means
               that  the current directory will be searched first
               and then the default directory.

FILES
     postscript.sty
          Macro file defining the macros for LaTeX.

     jobname.aux

          contains pointers to _p_s_t_e_x.

     file.ps
          EPSF PostScript picture files.

     file.psz
          File generated by _p_s_t_e_x and read in by LaTeX to  afford
          communication.

SEE ALSO

BUGS
     LaTeX forces a cumbersome interface  on  its  preprocessors,
     such  as  BiBTeX  and  _p_s_t_e_x.  After adding a new figure, or
     changing the specification in the LaTeX,  you  need  to  run
     LaTeX,  then  _p_s_b_o_x,  then  LaTeX  again  to  see the update
     results.  After a change to the PostScript, only  the  final
     LaTeX step is required.

     It is very hard to get troff to put in  backslashes  in  the
     documentation  in  all  the right places.  Some are missing,
     others are replaced by slashes.
