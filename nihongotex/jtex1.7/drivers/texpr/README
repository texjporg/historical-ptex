1. Last year we posted Canon LBP-8 driver for Berkeley UNIX (called
   TeXpr).  This is a new version (v1.2) of TeXpr.   Known bugs were
   fixed and some functions were added.
   Most notable change is that the driver supports PK font file format
   in addition to PXL format.

   This driver adopts 2-pass algorithm. Pass-1 (front end) runs as a
   user process, and pass-2 (back end) runs as a "d-filter" of printer
   daemon.
   We have not tested on System V UNIX, but we think you can run with
   a little change of source codes.

2. Contents
   this directory contains following files/directories.
	README --- this file
	texpr  --- front end of texpr
	dvi2lbp--- back end of texpr
	common --- common subroutines and headers
	other  --- example of output filter
	man.tex--- texpr manual

3. LBP-8 setup
   Setup your LBP-8, by setting DIP-SW suitably.
	. 8 bit, 1 stop-bit, no-parity, 9600 baud
	. full paint mode
	. no jam retry mode
   And check to run lpr normally.
   You can use 19200 baud if your host responds to XON/XOFF quickly.
   An example of the DIP-SW setting is 55 88 00 13 in hex.

4. Output filter check
   If your output filter issues hard reset command (\033c), change it to
   soft reset command (\033<). Hard reset command erases down-loaded font,
   so we can't use the font many times.
   Sample output filter is in ./other directory.

5. Site dependent editing
   
   1) common/def.h
	Define your LBP-8 model name. You can select one of five choices,
	LASERSHOT, LBP_8_A2, LBP_8_AJ2, LBP_8II_A2, or LBP_8II_AJ2.
	Other models (A1, AJ1) are inadequate for TeX, because "full paint
	mode" is not available.

        Define PK_FORMAT if you use PK font file, otherwise (PXL file)
        comment out that line.

	LIB means font library area name, change this if you wish.
	Default is /usr/lib/tex/fonts.

	LPR defines execl argument. If the device name of your LBP-8
	is other than "lp", add argument "-Pxxx" to the line.

   2) dvi2lbp/Makefile
	Default installation destination of dvi2lbp is /usr/local/lib,
	edit the name if you want.

   3) texpr/Makefile
	Default installation destination of texpr is /usr/local, you may
	edit this.

   4) /etc/printcap
	Add next line to your device description part.
	:df=/usr/local/lib/dvi2lbp:
        Sample flag setting of tty port is
        :fc#06300:fs#022:xs#040:
        
        Meaning of the sample flag is
             . CBREAK mode
             . LITOUT (8 bit output) mode
             . EVENP & ODDP (8 bit input) mode
        To set 8 bit input mode, you must set EVENP & ODDP in 4.2BSD,
        but you must clear EVENP & ODDP in Ultrix (CAUTION!!).

        Don't use RAW mode, because it disables XON/XOFF flow control.
        For more details, read Unix manual tty(4), printcap(5), and
        "4.2BSD Line Printer Spooler Manual".

   5) LIB(=/usr/lib/tex/fonts)
	Do chmod LIB writable to daemon.
	Daemon creates .down_font file to the directory.

6. make & install

   # cd texpr
   # make
   # make install
   # cd ../dvi2lbp
   # make
   # make install


Thats all, good luck!
