Sat Feb 25 13:19:50 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* texx2-page.c - added TeXPageSlamPages, in case we fail
	  to open a file and need to close exising windows. If we
	  don't, they can move around or redisplay, referencing dead
	  data structures.

	* texx2-page.c - reopening a file now leaves pages at the same
	  page number in the new file. this means you don't have to
	  reposition yourself when you open a file.

	* texx2-page.c - split TeXPageNewFile into two parts, because
	  value of DviTotalPages changes after an open, causing

	  it's a regular file before doing a setFile

	  with foreward travel (avoid freeing next page until it gets it)

	* texx2-page.c - fix double free in TeXPageNewFile (forgot to zero)

	* dvi-simple.c - fix double free for DviCount (forgot to zero)

	  dialog box.

	  which is rebuilt on each redisplay.

	* texx2-file.c - merged BuildPageLevel into BuildFileLevel.

Fri Feb 24 14:50:36 1989  Dana A. Chee  (dana at dino)

	* texx2-error.c - removed unneeded resource XtNresize (not used in
	  text widgets).
	  
	* texx2-file.c - changed strcpy to proper strncpy; created widgets
	  in order used for chaining (Form widget goes through child list
	  once to place children, if the order of their chaining is
	  different from their creation order, the results will not be
	  satisfactory).

	* texx2-widgets.c - let widgets dimension the form; build widgets
	  in correct order for chaining (Page within File now, see above
	  reasons).

	* texx2.c - use proper program and class names for XtInitialize.

	  properly, causing redraws to fail when not using backing store

Fri Feb 17 17:30:10 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

        * Added ``tied'' pages, Imakefile, man page

Tue Feb 14 11:49:11 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* Changed all args to widgets to be built use XtSetArg instead of
	automatic aggregate initializations.

	* Changed all callbacks to be built using XtAddCallback instead
	of automatic aggregate initializations.

	* Changes texx2-error.c to build a temporary _iobuf structure
	for _doprnt to print erorr messages if vsprintf is unavailable.

	field matching the selected page number, as opposed to the ordinal
	page number.
