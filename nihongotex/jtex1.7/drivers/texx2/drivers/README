This directory contains the source for TeXsun and TeX.

TeXSun requires SunView, which comes with SunOS3.0.
TeXx requires X-11.

Of the two, TeXsun has had the most extensions, because I've tended to
use SunView more than X-11 recently.

Tim Morgan of the Univ. of Calif, Irvin, has added support for the
\special commands generated by 'tpic' so that TeXsun can preview PIC
pictures.

The dvi_draw.c module does most of the work, so it shouldn't be long before
texx also supports tpic.
